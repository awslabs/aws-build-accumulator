Version 1.29.0 -- 2023-06-12
----------------------------

- Litani now measures the runtime of each job in fractional seconds and
	records this information in the "duration_ms" field in run.json.


Version 1.28.0 -- 2023-03-02
----------------------------
This is a bugfix release containing the following fix:
- Ensure signal handler does not run concurrently

  Currently, a signal handler may be invoked while another one is
  running.  This resulted in a race when two concurrent python functions
  attempted to read from and write to the same file.


Version 1.27.0 -- 2022-08-03
----------------------------
- Modify behavior of acquire-html-dir command
  If a build has finished, then a lock will not be acquired (and
  consequently the path to the HTML directory will not be
  printed to stdout) until the report has finished rendering.


Version 1.26.0 -- 2022-05-18
----------------------------

This release fixes an important bug and contains several other fixes
and improvements.

- Fix incorrect RC with --fail-on-pipeline-failure

  This fixes an important bug in --fail-on-pipeline-failure.  Prior to
  this commit, litani run-build would only terminate abnormally with
  this flag set when ninja terminated abnormally. This commit fixes
  this behavior so that litani run-build instead checks whether any
  pipeline failed, and terminates abnormally if so.

  When using --fail-on-pipeline-failure, `litani run-build` will now
  terminate with an exit code of 0 if all pipelines passed, and 10 if
  at least one of them failed.

- Fix litani(7) HTML documentation and improve font size and choice




Version 1.25.0 -- 2022-05-18
----------------------------
- Fix litani run.json and litani outcome-table.json man pages

- Keep litani.7 at the first index in report


- Accept lists of input/output files embedded in JSON files


Version 1.24.0 -- 2022-04-14
----------------------------
- Do not create HTML docs of Litani man pages if a flag is specified
  Running `doc/configure` with `--no-html` allows one
  to ultimately build only the man equivalent of the
  Litani documentation.

- License documentation under CC-BY-SA 4.0

- Fix changelog


Version 1.23.0 -- 2022-04-11
----------------------------
Summary
=======

- Add get-jobs and set-jobs subcommands

- Add concurrency-safe HTML directory API

- Various improvements to HTML output

- Various improvements to user-facing and developer documentation

- Various improvements to automated release workflow

- Litani now dumps the stderr of all jobs regardless of return code


Details
=======

- Add get-jobs and set-jobs subcommands

  Add two new subcommands for litani, get-jobs and set-jobs. These
  subcommands act as primitives for interacting with the list of jobs for a
  litani run. Testing indicates that using set-jobs is ~80x faster than using
  add-jobs sequentially.

  get-jobs returns the list of jobs that have been added to a litani run
  either to stdout or to a file specified by the user. set-jobs allows the
  user to overwrite the job list by passing in a new list of jobs through
  stdin, a file, or a json string.

  set-jobs allows the user to set many jobs at the same time without the
  overhead of starting up the python interpreter before each job is added.

  Using get-jobs and set-jobs together, the user can achieve the same
  effect as transform-jobs in a more flexible manner which may be more
  familiar to those used to working with unix pipelines or sequences.
  These functions have also replaced the underlying code of
  transform-jobs.


- Add concurrency-safe HTML directory API

  This feature adds 3 new commands that allow Litani clients to access the
  HTML report, either for continuous viewing or modification.

  - `litani print-html-dir` prints the path to a HTML report directory
    that will be continuously updated with new progress while litani
    run-build runs. This is the command for local users to use for viewing
    the HTML report in a browser, for example.
  - `litani acquire-html-dir` prints the path to an exclusively-locked
    HTML report directory. After this command terminates, the printed-out
    directory will not be deleted or modified until `litani release-html-dir`
    is subsequently called. This is the command to use when you require
    prolonged exclusive access to HTML data, for example while doing a
    file transfer.
  - `litani release-html-dir` releases the lock on a previously-acquired
    HTML report directory. This allows other processes to attempt to lock
    the directory, and also allows `litani run-build` to acquire the
    directory for garbage collection.

  This feature gives users a safe way to get the path to a HTML report
  directory that meets their usage requirements, and without relying on
  internal Litani implementation details.


- Improvements to HTML output:
  - The pipeline page displays a list of tags for any job that has tags
  - The front dashboard displays the total runtime after the run completes
  - Minor colour, wording, and font fixes


Version 1.22.0 -- 2022-03-15
----------------------------
- Print out stderr when a job fails
  The entire buffered stderr of a job that fails will now be printed to
  the terminal after the failing command line. This is to help users
  quickly debug these jobs without viewing the HTML report.

  This commit fixes #131.

- Fix content colour in dark mode

  Previously, some content would appear in a dark colour in dark mode
  because the "color" property was set in the .content class for light
  mode but the <body> element for dark mode.

- Rebuild run graph in transform jobs

  After receiving user input in transform jobs, discard old jobs and make
  a new run graph using the jobs received on stdin. This makes it so that
  running add-job in parallel with transform-jobs will fail.

- Add ids to sections on HTML dashboard

  Every major section on the HTML dashboard now has an "id" attribute,
  making it possible to link to those sections. Prior to this commit, it
  was not possible to link to specific graphs on the front page, for
  example. This PR also introduces a CONTRIBUTING.md file that contains
  guidance to continue this pattern.

- Do not run litani tests if 'no-test' label is set

- Fix space in release script

- Tell release engineer to push develop and release

  Previously, following the instructions would only push the release
  branch to origin, not the develop branch.

- Fix run-tests workflow file name


Version 1.21.0 -- 2022-03-04
----------------------------
- Add release script
  This commit adds a script that creates a new release when run. It takes
  the following actions:

  - Update the version number in lib/litani.py;
  - Generate a changelog and prompt the user to edit it;
  - Merge the release branch into develop, using the changelog for the
    merge commit;
  - Tag the release;
  - Create a new release candidate on the develop branch.

- Litani's homebrew formula is now released on homebrew-core

- Add --out-file flag to litani-dump-run

  With this commit, users can now dump run files to a file instead
  by passing --out-file flag with the file path to litani dump-run.

- Add run-tests workflow
  This commit runs Litani's test suite on PRs with label 'test'.

- Render rich output in dashboard, pipeline pages

  This feature allows users to render custom HTML data onto the HTML
  dashboard, allowing Litani jobs to display their results through tables,
  graphs, and other HTML format. This can be done both for the front page
  or on the pipeline page.

  The intention is that individual litani jobs can be used to measure
  metrics, and then print those metrics out in an easily-viewable format.
  Jobs that calculate metrics for the entire run can present those metrics
  as a graph on the front page. Jobs that calculate metrics for a single
  pipeline (or proof) can display the result on the pipeline page.

  Users use this feature by adding a tag to a litani job, using the --tags
  flag. If a job is tagged with front-page-text, Litani will render the
  job's output onto the front page, in its own section. A tag of
  literal-stdout will make Litani render the job's output onto the
  pipeline page, but without any HTML escaping.

- Add workflow to update gh-pages on release

- Sort pipelines by status and then name.

  The order with which pipelines appear in both the HTML dashboard is
  the same as the order with which they appear in the run.json. An e2e
  test was added to ensure that the order is indeed the intended one.


Version 1.20.0 -- 2022-02-11
----------------------------

This release introduces workflows for Litani that use GitHub Actions. It
additionally contains bug fixes.

- Workflow were added, which will create a Debian package as well as a PR
  against the aws/homebrew-tap repository in order to update the brew formula.

Bug fixes:

- Prevent file extension from appearing twice in dot dependency diagram.
- Litani dump-run will dump the latest run, if no build is concurrently running.
- Update doc, examples for transform-jobs command.


Version 1.19.0 -- 2022-02--01
----------------------------

- Change man page extension from .roff to its chapter. 

  This commit is in preparation for Litani to be installed on users'
  systems, where the man pages need to be installed in the correct
  location and have the correct prefix in order for the man program to
  find them.

- Inform user that jobs must be added in order for Litani to run a build


Version 1.18.0 -- 2022-01-24
----------------------------

- Add new transform-jobs command
- Add --fast option to Litani test suite
- Add --output-dir flag to Litani test suite
- Litani will no longer print errors when not connected to a tty device
- Add documentation for new flags


Version 1.17.0 -- 2022-01-10
----------------------------

- Litani will no longer crash when running in a directory where one of the
subdirectories contains a cache pointer from an earlier run.
- Litani will distinguish on the pipeline HTML page the jobs that are currently
running from ones whose execution has not started.


Version 1.16.0 -- 2021-12-01
----------------------------

This is a bugfix release.

- Litani will no longer crash when rendering dependency graphs of command lines
  containing HTML entities
- Litani will no longer crash when the graph rendering output fails in general.


Version 1.15.0 -- 2021-10-29
----------------------------

This is a bugfix release. It changes how Litani spawns commands so that it can
correctly terminate the command and all descendant processes if the job has an
associated timeout.


Version 1.14.0 -- 2021-10-21
----------------------------

- This release introduces custom stage names to Litani. It also improves the
  user experience by showcasing better synopses for jobs in the pipeline graphs
  as well as a pipeline summary at the top of the dashboard. Finally, this
  release also contains other QoL changes.



Version 1.13.0 -- 2021-09-29
----------------------------

- This version fixes a bug where artefact directories were not being
  copied correctly



Version 1.12.0 -- 2021-08-24
----------------------------

- The --phony-outputs flag now has a slightly changed semantic
    Outputs passed to --phony-outputs no longer need to be also passed
    to --outputs to be considered an output. That is, the set of outputs
    of a job is the union of the outputs and the phony outputs. This is
    a backward-compatible change that should make configure scripts
    shorter.

- The `dump-run` command is more reliable when being run in parallel



Version 1.11.1 -- 2021-08-16
----------------------------

- Make dependency on graphviz optional



Version 1.11.0 -- 2021-08-13
----------------------------

- Added --phony-outputs flag to litani add-job
- Added litani dump-run command
- Added auto-generated documentation for run.json schema
- Added more documentation



Version 1.10.0 -- 2021-07-11
----------------------------

- "aux" key added to run API
    This is intended for users to fill out their own custom data when
    processing the run.json file. The run.json file has a tightly
    specified schema that allows for no additions, but the "aux" key
    provides a way to add arbitrary data to a run.

- UI improvements
    The parallelism graph now shows the number of processing cores as a
    horizontal line, and the job memory usage section of the dashboard
    now displays a message if no memory trace was captured.



Version 1.9.0 -- 2021-06-29
---------------------------

- Manual pages
    Litani now has work-in-progress documentation, currently including
    man pages for the three most commonly-used subcommands

- Gnuplot dependency is now optional
    This is to support users who run Litani in minimal containers

- Improved usability of output directory symlink
    Litani init now prints the path to the symlink by default, unless
    the new --no-print-out-dir flag was passed



Version 1.8.0 -- 2021-06-24
---------------------------

- Job pool
    Users can now add jobs to a particular "job pool", which limits the
    parallelism of those jobs. Multiple pools can be created, each with
    their own parallelism limits. This is intended to inhibit the
    parallelism of jobs that use a contended resource, like disk I/O or
    network bandwidth.

- UI improvement on pipeline page
    Each job on the pipeline page now has a hyperlink to that job,
    making it easy to link to particularly interesting jobs hosted on
    the web.

- Memory profiler
    Litani can now profile the memory of particular jobs and display
    graphs of those jobs' memory use on the dashboard. This can be
    helpful when deciding when to place particular jobs into a job pool.

- Parallelism measurement
    Litani now tracks how many jobs are running in parallel at any one
    moment, and displays that as a graph on the dashboard. This can be
    helpful when trying to increase CPU core utilization or trying to
    use cloud resources as efficiently as possible.



Version 1.7.1 -- 2021-05-13
---------------------------

- This minor release fixes a bug with the graph renderer.


Version 1.7.0 -- 2021-05-12
---------------------------

- The --outcome-table flag can be used to specify a JSON file that
  Litani uses to decide whether a job was successful.

- The --output-directory flag can be used to specify where Litani should
  write its output files.

- The --output-symlink flag can be used to create a symbolic link to the
  output directory.

- The --output-prefix flag is an alternative to --output-directory that
  specifies a directory, into which Litani will create a unique
  directory for writing its output files.

- Litani now displays a table of contents on each pipeline page. Each
  entry in the table of contents is a hyperlink that points to a job on
  the page.

- Litani now renders each pipeline as a graph and displays that graph on
  the pipeline page, allowing users to see the dependency layout of all
  the jobs in the pipeline.


Version 1.6.0 -- 2021-03-10
---------------------------

This release fixes a bug where litani would crash when given the
`--timeout` option.


Version 1.5.0 -- 2021-03-08
---------------------------

- The implementation of directory locking no longer releases the lock
  upon creation. This fixes a problem where external processes could
  release a lock that a different process had acquired.


Version 1.4.0 -- 2021-03-02
---------------------------

- lib.litani now exposes a LockableDirectory API that can be used to
  lock directories against concurrent access by more than one process.
  External processes can use this API to lock report directories while
  reading or copying them.

- Litani now touches a file called `.litani-expired` in HTML report
  directories as soon as a new report directory has been written, and
  after the `html` symbolic link has been updated to point to the new
  directory. Litani then deletes all report directories that are both
  expired and unlocked.


Version 1.3.0 -- 2021-02-24
---------------------------

- Litani now has a top-level command called `print-capabilities` that
  prints out a list of features in either human or machine-readable format.
  The intention is that any new API-changing features will be accompanied by a
  new entry in this list


Version 1.2.0 -- 2021-02-24
---------------------------

- Litani now renders the HTML directory atomically. The `html` directory is now
  a symbolic link that is updated only after the report has been completely
  written.
- Added dark mode for all report pages


Version 1.1.0 -- 2021-02-03
---------------------------

- Added a new top-level command, `litani graph`. This dumps a
  Graphviz-formatted graph to stdout that describes the dependency graph
  of the jobs that have been added so far.
