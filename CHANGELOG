Version 1.3.0 -- 2021-02-24
---------------------------

- Litani now has a top-level command called `print-capabilities` that
  prints out a list of features in either human or machine-readable format.
  The intention is that any new API-changing features will be accompanied by a
  new entry in this list


Version 1.2.0 -- 2021-02-24
---------------------------

- Litani now renders the HTML directory atomically. The `html` directory is now
  a symbolic link that is updated only after the report has been completely
  written.
- Added dark mode for all report pages


Version 1.1.0 -- 2021-02-03
---------------------------

- Added a new top-level command, `litani graph`. This dumps a
  Graphviz-formatted graph to stdout that describes the dependency graph
  of the jobs that have been added so far.
